## Data Science Foundations Specialization

Nearly one in four job postings in the US alone require some data science skills and employers are paying up to 14% more for those skills. (Report : ExcelinEd & the Burning Glass Institute).

This powerful specialisation from the University of London and IBM gives you the perfect academic and industry-informed practical introduction to data science. You get:

-            Progress transfer for the University of London’s BSc in Computer Science

-            The foundational skills and knowledge you need to get a job in a data-rich environment.

During this specialisation, you’ll be introduced to data science, statistics, programming, computational thinking, machine learning, and more. You’ll discover the role of data science in today’s data-driven world. Plus, you’ll get hands-on using IBM’s data science tools, giving you practical experience to talk about in interviews.

Half the teaching is provided by Goldsmiths, University of London, giving you a strong academic foundation. The other half, designed by IBM, provides real-world professional insight supported by practical projects and a capstone project for your resume.

The “Problems and Algorithms in Data Science” course is a great preview of the BSc Computer Science degree with the opportunity to roll your progress into the degree, if you successfully apply and register.
